  A will break left, D will break right, W will break up, S will break down.

- Hold B, a number 1 - 8 and a WASD direction to place a block (I'll give examples)

  The blocks around you are the ones you can build. If they are black, you do not have the sufficient materials required to build them.
  The three blocks at the bottom left are to display the amount of materials you are currently carrying. It displays this with brightness. Black being none, and brighter being more. The colour of the inventory blocks corresponds to the certain mineral you are carrying.
  Hold a number 1 - 8 and use WASD to build a certain block.
