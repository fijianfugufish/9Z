  The blocks around you are the ones you can build. If they are black, you do not have the sufficient materials required to build them.
  
  The three blocks at the bottom left are to display the amount of materials you are currently carrying. It displays this with brightness. Black being none, and brighter being more. The colour of the inventory blocks corresponds to the certain mineral you are carrying.

  Hold a number 1 - 8 and use WASD, while holding B, to build a certain block. (I'm sorry)
